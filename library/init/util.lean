  This function has a native implementation where
  the thunk is interrupted if it takes more than 'max' "heartbeats" to compute it.
  The heartbeat is approx. the maximum number of memory allocations (in thousands) performed by 'f ()'.
  This is a deterministic way of interrupting long running tasks. -/
